## A star algorithm implementation

### Input 

This algorithm will take a map (consisting of # and .) and find the shortest path from S to E (denoted on this map). A dot (.) denotes an open 'space', while a # represents a wall.

### Output

The algorithm will output a set of cardinal directions (N(orth) E(ast) S(outh) W(est)) from S(tart) to E(nd)
